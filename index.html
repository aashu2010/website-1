                  Living in today's sedentary world, it's important we all make our health a priority. The benefits of staying physically fit simply cannot be overstated. Regular exercise reduces your risk for heart disease, stroke, diabetes, obesity, and even some cancers. It strengthens your heart, improves circulation, and lowers resting heart rate and blood pressure. Fit people have more energy, sleep better, and are better equipped to handle stress.
                  
                  Fitness is key to maintaining a healthy body weight and optimal body composition. Exercise, along with proper nutrition, burns calories and fat while increasing metabolism and building lean muscle. The more active you are, the easier it becomes to get fit and stay that way. Developing exercise habits now will pay off for the rest of your life.
                  
                  Staying in shape benefits your mind as well as your body. Working out increases blood and oxygen flow to the brain, improving memory, focus and concentration. It stimulates neurotransmitters and encourages neurogenesis - the growth of new brain cells. Exercise is proven to help prevent age-related cognitive decline.
                  
                  Beyond the physical perks, fitness boosts self-esteem and confidence. Meeting goals gives you a real sense of accomplishment. Increased strength and endurance allow for greater independence. Working out can provide an opportunity for social interaction as well. When you feel fit, you look better and feel better about yourself overall.
